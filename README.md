## Acknowledgments
The template for note taking is basically a modified/simplified version from [CASTEL](https://castel.dev/). If you want even more advanced work visit his website. For how to optimize your note taking routine for during courses/workshops the articles from his website.

The template for the reviewer and author replies are based on the work of [github-mschroen](https://github.com/mschroen/review_response_letter). I added a few extra things that I prefer and I removed a couple that I didn't find useful. If you prefer to use markdown rather than LaTeX for your replies check his github page.
