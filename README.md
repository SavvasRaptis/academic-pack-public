# Academic Template Pack
![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

Each folder contains some of the templates (Mainly in LaTeX/Overleaf) I am using for my work.

## Content
* [note_template](note_template): Contains the template I use for writing notes on different topics.

* [author_response_template](author_response_template): Contains the template I use to reply to reviewers.

* [reviewer_comment_template](reviewer_comment_template): Contains the template I use for reviewing

* [teaching_experience_template](teaching_experience_template): Contains the template I use for organizing my teaching experience. It can also be used for making short syllabus for the courses you are responsible for.

To use any of these, simply add the content as a project in Overleaf.

## TODO
* ~~Add mint in all the cases and copy paste some code as an example~~

## Acknowledgments
The template for note taking is basically a modified/simplified version taken from [CASTEL](https://castel.dev/). If you want even more advanced work visit his website. For information on how to optimize your note taking routine during courses/workshops, read the articles on his website.

The template for the reviewer and author replies are based on the work of [github-mschroen](https://github.com/mschroen/review_response_letter). I added a few extra things that I prefered and I removed a couple that I didn't find useful. If you prefer to use markdown rather than LaTeX for your replies check his github page.
