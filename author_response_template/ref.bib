abstract = {Abstract Using Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) data, we find, classify, and analyze transient dynamic pressure enhancements in the magnetosheath (jets) from May 2015 to May 2019. A classification algorithm is presented, using in situ MMS data to classify jets ( ) into different categories according to their associated angle between interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and the bow shock normal vector (θBn). Jets appearing for θBn < 45 are referred to as quasi-parallel, while jets appearing for θBn > 45 as quasi-perpendicular jets. Furthermore, we define those jets that occur at the boundaries between quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath as boundary jets. Finally, encapsulated jets are jet-like structures with similar characteristics to quasi-parallel jets while the surrounding plasma is of quasi-perpendicular nature. We present the first statistical results of such a classification and provide comparative statistics for each class. Furthermore, we investigate correlations between jet quantities. Quasi-parallel jets have the highest dynamic pressure while occurring more often than quasi-perpendicular jets. The infrequent quasi-perpendicular jets have a much smaller duration, velocity, and density and are therefore relatively weaker. We conclude that quasi-parallel and boundary jets have similar properties and are unlikely to originate from different generation mechanisms. Regarding the encapsulated jets, we suggest that they are a special subset of quasi-parallel jets originating from the flanks of the bow shock, for large IMF cone angles although a relation to flux transfer events (FTEs) and magnetospheric plasma is also possible. Our results support existing generation theories, such as the bow shock ripple and SLAMS-associated mechanisms while indicating that other factors may contribute as well.},

ABSTRACT={Magnetosheath jets are transient, localized dynamic pressure enhancements found downstream of the Earth's bow shock in the magnetosheath region. Using a pre-existing database of magnetosheath jets we train a neural network to distinguish between jets found downstream of a quasi-parallel bow shock (<mml:math id="M1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo><</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math>) and jets downstream of a quasi-perpendicular bow shock (<mml:math id="M2" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>></mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math>). The initial database was compiled using MMS measurements in the magnetosheath (downstream) to identify and classify them as “quasi-parallel” or “quasi-perpendicular,” while the neural network uses only solar wind (upstream) measurements from the OMNIweb database. To evaluate the results, a comparison with three physics-based modeling approaches is done. It is shown that neural networks are systematically outperforming the other methods by achieving a ~93\% agreement with the initial dataset, while the rest of the methods achieve around 80\%. The better performance of the neural networks likely is due to the fact that they use information from more solar wind quantities than the physics-based models. As a result, even in the absence of certain upstream properties, such as the IMF direction, they are capable of accurately determining the jet class.}
